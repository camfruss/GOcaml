# Installation

There are many ways to set up a working environment to run this project. As of right now, we only need one additional package, Graphics. 

Using the original cs3110-2020fa opam switch, run:
`opam install graphics`
`opam user-setup install`

To actually interact with our program, we have provided a Makefile:
- `make build`: compiles all the necessary files
- `make clean`: deletes files generated by `make build`
- `make test`: runs our oUnit testing suite
- `make zip`: creates a zip file with the important files
- `make gocaml`: launches the terminal version of the game
- `make gui`: launches the graphical user interface (in progress)

These last two are the most important for interacting with GOCaml.
